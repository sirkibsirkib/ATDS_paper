% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

% We need to adapt to this new era, rather than expand our old toolsets to match complex the new data structures and protocols.

Why stick to primitives developed decades ago when building complex applications on modern parallel and distributed systems? Our work demonstrates how higher-level tools are a better fit for this purpose. The programming languages\footnote{This work often uses the terms `language', `library', `tool', etc. interchangeably as this detail is irrelevant to our argument.} Reo, Chapel and Linda are examples that manage to compete with widely used message-passing approaches such as MPI. We identify four effective requirements for languages intended for this purpose: reliability, productivity, expressivity and performance.
This work examines case studies of novel, applicable programming languages, and discusses how they satisfy the requirements and which trade-offs are still necessary. 
We attempt to break the \textit{illusion} that alternative programming languages and tools are less performant than established message passing frameworks.
% test test test test test test test test test test test test 
%tradeoffs that are commnly believed to existed are now dismissed
%in contrast with past belief/common belief/

% We should use the right tools for the appropriate task at hand.
